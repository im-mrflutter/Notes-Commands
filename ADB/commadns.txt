run that app in you emulator and run this command on your terminal :

its will show to you a result that has to part . package_Name/Activity_Name . like :

mCurrentFocus=Window{4c3fa1f u0 com.instagram.android/com.instagram.mainactivity.InstagramMainActivity}

after the catching the data run this command to run the app :

- better way :

if you just have the package name you can use this command :

adb shell monkey -p The_Package_Name -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1

some thing like :

adb shell monkey -p com.instagram.android -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
